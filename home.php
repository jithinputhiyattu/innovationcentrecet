      <h2 class="home-items" >Coding club - coding your dreams</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Motto :Our aim is to increase the diversity of the students studying to challenge the stereotypes and to create accessible opportunities for all students to experience the subject first hand.
 The club holds regular sessions for both beginners and people better versed in code. It also caters to the needs of non CS students who might need help with coding related to their projects. Since its inception the club has been actively engaged in bringing together coders in the campus by establishing a platform for them to help each other out and improve their skillset and language knowledge. A number of seminars and workshops are conducted by the club to provide exposure and encouragement. The club conducts coding based competitions and also actively sends contingents to represent the college in events in various colleges.
